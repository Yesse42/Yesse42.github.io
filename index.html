            About This Site
        </h1>
        <p>
            Hello there and welcome to my website! I'm Jesse Robinett, 
            a third year undergradate at UCSD's Sixth College majoring in Oceanic and Atmospheric Science
            and Applied Mathematics, and I'd like to thank you for stopping by. This site has the twofold purpose of
            providing me a forum to explain fascinating local (La Jolla/San Diego) weather phenomena to the general public.
            while also hosting my academic information online.
            You may have noticed that in spite of that second purpose there's a paucity of research on here, but don't fret;
            I'm making progress on that front. If you want a succint summary of my current achievements then look no further than
            the link to my CV at the bottom of this page.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Research Interests
        </h2>
        <p>
            My primary research topic is California's ubiquitous summertime coastal low cloudiness, pictures of which
            you'll see scattered throughout this site. Beyond merely being aesthetic, these clouds play a pivotal role
            in generating coastal California's extremely mild summertime temperatures, which will be explored elsewhere in
            this website. In my current research I am attempting to identify possible trends in low cloudiness, but before
            that can be done I need to get some heavy data wrangling out of the way. The long term airport low cloudiness datasets
            are riddled with strange and unphysical artifacts, and it's been a bit of a game of whack-a-mole finding them all. Hopefully 
            once that is done I can get on to more interesting things!
        </p>
        <p>
            Some other areas of atmospheric science that I'm interested in are weather and climate modeling, and Southern California's 
            Santa Ana winds.

            Beyond School
        </h2>
        <p>
            Everybody's gotta have a little fun sometimes! Some of my favorite pasttimes include reading, hiking,
            skiing, biking, running, and Dungeons and Dragons. I also like to dabble in cooking and photography occasionally.
            Indeed, all the photographs you see in the background of this site were taken by me; hopefully you
            think they look as nice as I think they do.
