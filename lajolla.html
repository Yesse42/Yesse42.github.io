            The Climate of La Jolla
        </h1>

        <p>
            There is a weather station located on UCSD's campus at SIO's Southwest Fisheries building.
            Although its period of record is a short 8 years, it can still grant some valuable insight into the climate on campus.
            Let's take a look at some summary statistics I generated for it!

        <p>
            As should be apparent, UCSD's climate takes moderation to the absolute extreme. 
            With the change in average high temperature between the coldest and warmest months standing at a mere 11ºF, 
            and the difference in average low temperatures being 13ºF, the seasons here are pretty muted, to say the least
