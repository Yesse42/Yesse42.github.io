            If you want to learn more about the weather, then here are some great jumping off points
        </p>
        <h2>
            <a href="https://www.weather.gov">National Weather Service</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            A fantastic resource for all things weather related, including forecasts. If you've ever
            got concerns about the weather, I strongly recommend this over whatever default phone weather app you have.
            Their forecast discussions are a great way to ease into an understanding of basic atmospheric phenomena as well.

        <h2>
            <a href="https://julialang.org">The Julia Programming Language</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            My programming language of choice, and the language I coded up the data analysis
            scripts for other parts of this website in. Still a bit niche, but if you're not
            hampered by the large runtime memory consumption, JIT compilation latency, and
            the relatively underdeveloped static anlysis tools (which are consistenly improving)
            then give it a try.
