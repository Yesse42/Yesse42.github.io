            If you want to learn more about the atmosphere, then here are some great jumping off points
        </p>
        <h2>
            <a href="https://www.weather.gov">National Weather Service</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            A fantastic resource for all things weather related, including forecasts. If you've ever
            got concerns about the weather, I strongly recommend this over your phone weather app.
            Their forecast discussions are a great way to ease into understanding basic atmospheric phenomena as well.
        </p>

            <a href="https://www.meted.ucar.edu/index.php">COMET MetEd</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            A site with many free courses in a variety of atmospheric science topics. A great place to go if you feel like
            the blog posts in this website just weren't enough for you and you crave even more weather. The courses span a wide variety of
            difficulties too, so even if you don't know much math or physics I encourage you to give it a try.
        </p>

        <p>
            A great place to look at the output from numerical weather models. Just remember, always look at as many models as possible,
            and ensembles are your friends. <a href="response.html">They may still lead you astray though, especially as you peer ever farther into the future.</a>

            An absolutely gorgeous satellite imagery viewer; images of the earth from space never get old. If the weather's ever looking interesting
            outside, then come to this site to get a bird's eye view of the situation. Keep an eye on the clock though; it's all too easy
            to get hypnotized by the beautiful swirls.

        <p>
            If you are mathematically inclined, this textbook by Wallace and Hobbs provides a more rigorous introduction to atmospheric
            science than what you'll find on this website. Check it out if you want your understanding of the weather to rest on a more firm base than intuition.

        </h2>
        <p>
            Have you ever wanted to get (near) real time measurements of the weather around you or anywhere else in the US? Then this is the site for you!
            Now when you want to argue about the temperature you can grab some data to back up your claims. Just be warned, not all data on this site is quality controlled.
        </p>
        <h2>
            <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/us-climate-normals/">NOAA Climate Normals Access</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            Find high quality average temperatures and precipation for a huge amount of stations across the US. If MesoWest's relative lack of quality control frightens you,
            then this should be more up your alley.

            Didn't quite fit anywhere else, but I still think these sites could be worth your time.

        </h2>
        <p>
            I could never pass up the option to evangelize about my favorite programming language.
            I used Julia to code up the data analysis
            scripts for other parts of this website in. Still a bit niche, but if you're not
            hampered by the large runtime memory consumption, JIT compilation latency, and
            the relatively underdeveloped static anlysis tools (all of which are consistenly improving)
            then give it a try. I in particular love how composable the language is, and how easy it is 
            to write performant code.
